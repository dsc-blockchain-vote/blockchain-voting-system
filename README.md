# DeVote (Decentralized-Vote)

## Voter and electoral fraud are persistent problems endured by organisations of all types and sizes - from student governments to national governments. Examples of voter fraud are voting by impersonation and voting by ineligible voters. Electoral fraud can occur if election officials maliciously alter or remove ballots that are cast. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for elections to be held in person, but organisations are weary of moving elections online due to concerns of cyberattacks or data manipulation.
